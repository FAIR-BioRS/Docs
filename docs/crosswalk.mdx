We summarize below how the FAIR-BioRS guidelines as well as other relevant guidelines align with the FAIR4RS Principles. A description of the compliance and a score are provided (0 = Do not provide actionable instructions for complying with the corresponding FAIR4RS Principle, 1 = Provide actionable instructions that only allow to comply partially with the corresponding FAIR4RS Principle, 2 = Provide actionable instructions for compying fully with the corresponding FAIR4RS Principles).

    Archiving the software on Zenodo/Figshare (step 5.2) will assign a Digital Object Identifier
    (DOI) which is a unique and persistent identifier. Archiving the software on Software Heritage
    (step 5.3) will assign a SoftWare Heritage persistent IDentifier (SWHID) which is also a unique

    Resource Description Framework (RDF) and aligns with the Biomedical Resource Ontology (BRO) and
    the Eagle-i Resource Ontology (ERO) along with few additions) (step 6). The prescribed license
    documentation (step 1.2), development best practices (steps 2.1 and 2.2), documentation of the
    software (step 3), and prescribed metadata files (step 4) will contain additional metadata that

    DataCite for generating a DOI and that metadata will always remain accessible through DataCite's
    registry. Additionally, Zenodo keeps metadata stored in high-availability database servers
    separate from the software files. Bio.tools/RRID Portal (step 6) will also keep the metadata
    accessible even if the software is no longer available e.g., on the version control system
    platform or any of the archiving repositories.
