To ensure the FAIR-BioRS guidelines are easily accessible and widely embraced by researchers, a workflow to streamline the process of implementing the FAIR-BioRS guidelines as been developed. This workflow is incorporated in FAIRshare, a software application aimed at simplifying the processes for making biomedical research data and software FAIR. FAIRshare takes the userâ€™s software-related dataset as input when they are ready to publish a new software version and walks them step-by-step into implementing the FAIR-BioRS guidelines through an intuitive graphical user interface and automation. FAIRshare is free and open-source. Download FAIRshare and find out more on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fairdataihub/fairshare).
