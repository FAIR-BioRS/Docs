## Overview

The FAIR Biomedical Research Software (FAIR-BioRS) guidelines are a set of minimal and actionable step-by-step instructions for optimizing the reusability of biomedical research software in-line with the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) Principles for Research Software (a.k.a. FAIR4RS Principles).

## Research software

In this document we follow the definition established in "" and designate by research software ""

## Why the FAIR-BioRS guidelines were needed?

Research software (including scripts, computational models, notebooks, code libraries, etc.) is becoming increasingly vital in biomedical research. Research software plays a fundamental role not only in collecting, analyzing, and processing data but has also become the centerpiece of many research projects aimed at developing computational models to understand and predict various physical phenomena.

The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guiding principles published in 2016 constitute the foundation for data management practices adopted by researchers, government agencies, private funders, and scholarly publishers to ensure optimal reusability of data by humans and machines. While postulated for all digital research objects, they fail to capture the specific traits of software such as dependencies and versioning. Consequently, reformulated FAIR guiding principles tailored for software have been proposed. Work from the Research Data Alliance (RDA) FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group is the most extensive on the topic. Just like the original FAIR guiding principles, the FAIR4RS guiding principles are aspirational and do not provide practical instructions and actionable items to the researchers.

To fill this gap, we derived the first minimal and actionable step-by-step guidelines for biomedical researchers to make their research software compliant with the FAIR4RS principles. We designate these guidelines as the FAIR Biomedical Research Software (FAIR-BioRS) guidelines. Our process for developing these guidelines, based on a thorough review of current practices in the field, is available in our associated manuscript.
