We summarize below how the FAIR-BioRS guidelines as well as other relevant guidelines align with the FAIR4RS Principles. A description of the compliance and a score are provided (0 = Do not provide actionable instructions for complying with the corresponding FAIR4RS Principle, 1 = Provide actionable instructions that only allow to comply partially with the corresponding FAIR4RS Principle, 2 = Provide actionable instructions for compying fully with the corresponding FAIR4RS Principles).

    DataCite for generating a DOI and that metadata will always remain accessible through DataCite's
    registry. Additionally, Zenodo keeps metadata stored in high-availability database servers
    separate from the software files. Bio.tools/RRID Portal (step 6) will also keep the metadata
